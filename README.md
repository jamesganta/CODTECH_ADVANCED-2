# Overview of the Project



Sentiment Analysis with NLP

Sentiment Analysis is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the emotional tone or subjectivity of a piece of text. This can range from simple positive/negative classifications to more nuanced categories like joy, anger, sadness, etc.

Key Applications:

Business:
Customer Feedback Analysis: Understanding customer satisfaction, identifying areas for improvement, and predicting churn.
Brand Monitoring: Tracking brand reputation, identifying potential crises, and measuring the impact of marketing campaigns.
Social Media Monitoring: Analyzing public opinion, identifying trending topics, and understanding customer sentiment towards competitors.
Politics:
Opinion Mining: Analyzing public opinion on political issues, candidates, and policies.
Predicting Election Outcomes: Gauging public sentiment towards different candidates and parties.
Healthcare:
Patient Feedback Analysis: Understanding patient satisfaction with healthcare services and identifying areas for improvement.
Drug Reviews: Analyzing patient reviews of medications to identify potential side effects and improve drug safety.
Instructions: Perform Sentiment Analysis on a Dataset of Customer Reviews using TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression

Data Collection and Preparation:

Gather a Dataset: Obtain a dataset of customer reviews (e.g., from online platforms like Amazon, Yelp, or TripAdvisor). Ensure the dataset contains a sufficient number of reviews with corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
Data Cleaning:
Remove irrelevant characters (e.g., HTML tags, special characters).
Handle missing values (e.g., by removing rows with missing values or imputing missing values).
Convert text to lowercase.
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Word Removal: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "the," "a," "is").
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
Part-of-Speech Tagging (Optional): Identify the grammatical role of each word in the sentence.
Feature Extraction (TF-IDF Vectorization):

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures the importance of a term across the entire dataset.
TF-IDF combines TF and IDF to give higher weights to terms that are important within a document but rare across the dataset.
Create a TF-IDF Matrix: Represent each review as a vector of TF-IDF scores for each word in the vocabulary.
Model Training (Logistic Regression):

Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Model: Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data. Logistic Regression is a suitable classification algorithm for sentiment analysis as it predicts the probability of a review belonging to a particular sentiment class.
Tune Hyperparameters (Optional): Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength, solver) to optimize model performance.
